        I am learning a lot about html and css. In particular, I am learning about grid-row styling.<br>
        At this time, I am becoming proficient with html and css. I like the course I am taking now.<br>
        I like COMS 3163, Web Programming. I am satisfied with my progress.

        The weather today is beautiful. We have sixty-four degrees Fahrenheit with maximum sunshine<br>
        and no wind. THe ice has just about melted off the roads. I am now able to get out of the<br> 
        yard. I need to check the air in my tires.
